# play35
This project is a chance for me to play with Python 3.5 and practice a few good habits such as:

* setting up an open source project the right way using notes such as: https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/
* try out cookiecutter to set up project template - http://www.pydanny.com/cookie-project-templates-made-easy.html
* using the features of git and github
* test driven development - using py.test or nose?
* sphinx-based documentation
* try out challenges on hackerrank.com
* get comfortable using virtual environments - virtualenv or conda? - http://stiglerdiet.com/blog/2015/Nov/24/my-python-environment-workflow-with-conda/
