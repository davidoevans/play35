# play35
This project is a chance for me to play with Python 3.5 and practice a few good habits such as:

* setting up an open source project the right way using notes such as: https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/
* using the features of git and github
* test driven development - using py.test or nose?
* sphinx-based documentation
* try out challenges on hackerrank.com
