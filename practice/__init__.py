"""
This practice module is the heart of what this project is all about.  This is a space for me (and others if they'd like)
to practice their python v3.5 programming.

Ideally, this will use 'best practices' which includes keeping this Sphinx-based documentation up to date and ensuring
there are good tests in place.
